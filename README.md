# image-folio
A Image Editing Web App with PHP and Vue 

Please clone the repositry. 
Then move the PHP_folio folder to root directory on PHP server. 
Please create a database with test_db name. 
Now Import the test_db.sql sql file from db folder.
See the project on this url: http://localhost/PHP_folio/
Note: Please dont change the PHP_folio name because I used this path for API call from vue project.


Now go the frontend-vue folder and run bellow command

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
