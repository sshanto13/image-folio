# image-folio
A Image Editing Web App with PHP and Vue 

Please clone the repositry. 
Then move the PHP_folio folder to root directory on PHP server. 
Please create a database with test_db name. 
Now Import the test_db.sql sql file from db folder.
See the project on this url: http://localhost/PHP_folio/

This is a also Standalone project (PHP) where you can edit image through this : http://localhost/PHP_folio/


This is my another try with Vue.

Now go the frontend-vue folder and run bellow command

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev


Note: Please dont change the PHP_folio name because I used this path for API call from vue project.
